    <p>Corruption and abuse of power is nothing new to the citizens of the Philippines. </p>

    <p>With a long colonial past, it took only two decades since independence for infamous dictator Ferdinand Marcos to take power in 1965. Marcos established an authoritarian government that was able to steal up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/10bn-dollar-question-marcos-millions-nick-davies"target=blank>$10 billion</a> from government contracts to put directly in his pocket via offshore accounts, shell corporations and false foundations. He died of natural causes before he was ever put in front of a judge in international court, and most of that money has never been found.</p>

    <p>It’s happening again, if you were to ask Filipino citizens today.</p>

    <p>Marcos’ son, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., was elected President in 2022; his Vice President is the daughter of Bongbong’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte — who was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/g-s1-90024/icc-charges-former-philippine-president-duterte-crimes-against-humanity"target=blank>recently charged</a> with three counts of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. While Bongbong isn’t being accused of killing 76 people like Duterte, he is being accused of attempting to steal a large portion of the <a href="https://cids.up.edu.ph/flood-control-fiasco-a-policy-reckoning-for-accountability-in-the-philippines/" target=blank>$10 billion</a> set aside for flood mitigation projects between July 2022 and May 2025.</p>

    <p>Finance Secretary Ralph Recto <a href="https://manilastandard.net/business/314637603/ghost-flood-control-projects-cost-philippines-p118-5-billion-steal-jobs.html" target=blank>estimated</a> that up to $2 billion of that budget was put solely into “ghost projects” that have seen no progress whatsoever since their inception. Only 15 contractors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/philippines-says-up-to-70-in-flood-budget-is-lost-to-corruption?embedded-checkout=true" target=blank>were assigned</a> to 20% of that figure, some of which were awarded with multiple projects. Prominently, contractor Pacifico Discaya has been under scrutiny as being one of the worst offenders in this scheme. It was discovered that Discaya was in charge of various companies that were awarded multiple ghost projects. Discaya had 30 luxury cars <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2106791/boc-secures-more-discaya-linked-luxury-cars-30-cars-now-under-custody?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target=blank> repossessed</a> by the government in September as the public started to get wind of the scandal.</p>

    <p>Following the virality of posts from prominent government officials’ children flaunting their wealth, members of Gen Z started organizing on TikTok and WhatsApp in a similar fashion to how we saw Nepal protestors utilize Discord to overthrow their government in the same month. On September 21st, this culminated in the largest protest seen in the country since 1986’s “The People Power Revolution” protest that was able to topple the Marcos regime.</p>

    <p>While investigations are ongoing in every level of the Filipino government, public outrage is growing while confidence in the legitimacy of these investigations is fading.</p>

    <div class="colored-headers"><h3> Lethal Flooding </h3></div>
    <p>According to Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/philippines-says-up-to-70-in-flood-budget-is-lost-to-corruption?embedded-checkout=true" target=blank>up to</a> 70% of public funds allotted for flood control have been lost directly to corruption. There <a href="https://ndrrmc.gov.ph/index.php/8-ndrrmc-update" target=blank>have been</a> around 200 deaths and 400 injuries because of flooding since July 2022, with around 350,000 homes being damaged.</p> </div>

    <div class="colored-headers"><h3> Following the Money </h3></div>
    <p>Bongbong is being accused of attempting to steal from the $10 billion set aside for flood mitigation projects. Recto estimated that up to $2 billion of that budget was put solely into “ghost projects” that have seen no progress.</p></div>

<div class="icon">
<img src="ghost-icon.png" alt="An icon of a ghastly ghost.">
   <div class="colored-headers"><h3> "Ghost Projects" </h3></div>
    <p>Ghost projects are fraudulent infastructure or development contracts from the goverment given to an outisde contractor that have seen limited construction, if any. Over 400 of these ghost projects across the country have been identified during investigations.</p></div>

    <div class="colored-headers"><h3> A Unifying Symbol </h3></div>
    <p>The <em>One Piece</em> flag has become a rallying symbol for Gen Z across the globe fighting corruption in their respective countries; the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, France, and more.</p></div>
